# Clopen Mic Night #4: Chestnuts Roasting on a Clopen Fire
On Tuesday 19th December at 8-9pm (GMT), we will be hosting the fourth Clopen Mic Night.

The show is free to watch, but we support our performers and pay our behind-the-scenes team 
for their work, so if you'd like to make a contribution - for example, as much as you'd pay 
for a ticket to a show - you can do so at any time by visiting 
[ko-fi.com/clopenmicnight](https://ko-fi.com/clopenmicnight) or
[paypal.me/tmipuk](https://paypal.me/tmipuk).
