**Clopen Mic Night #3: Clopen Sept** will take place on **Tuesday 13th September** from **8-9pm** (UK time).
The show will be available to watch for free, and a recording of the show will be available to watch for a limited time.

The show is free to watch, but we support our performers and pay our behind-the-scenes team 
for their work, so if you'd like to make a contribution - for example, as much as you'd pay 
for a ticket to a show - you can do so at any time by visiting 
[ko-fi.com/clopenmicnight](https://ko-fi.com/clopenmicnight) or
[paypal.me/tmipuk](https://paypal.me/tmipuk).

A list of all our past shows, with links to line-ups can be found [here](list.md).
