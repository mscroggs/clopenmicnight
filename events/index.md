[**Clopen Mic Night #5: The Power of Five**](/events/2023-12-19) will take place on **Thursday 1st May** from **8-9pm** (UK time).
You will be able to watch the show live or watch a recording of the show for a limited time on the [Clopen Mic YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/live/JVu2CG6kDVE).

The show is free to watch, but we support our performers and pay our behind-the-scenes team 
for their work, so if you'd like to make a contribution - for example, as much as you'd pay 
for a ticket to a show - you can do so at any time by visiting 
[ko-fi.com/clopenmicnight](https://ko-fi.com/clopenmicnight) or

    about="Pseudorandom Ensemble is a mathematically-inspired musical combo who are experimenting with the form of online collaborative musical performances and exploring what it means to be normal. Our members change from show to show; at Clopen Mic Night youâ€™ll see Colin Beveridge, Gavan Fantom, Lucy Rycroft-Smith, Martin Harris and Sam Hartburn. Between us we have 2 PhDs, 6 degrees (unless you count PhDs as degrees as well, in which case it's 8), 7 pets (unless you count robot vacuum cleaners) and an unverified number of piano keys. Counting things is hard."
