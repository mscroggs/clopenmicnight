{% include _double_act.html
    about="Lucy Rycroft-Smith and Darren Macey are mathematics education researchers, writers and designers at the University of Cambridge, as well as stand-up comedians at the stage of their careers fondly known as ‘hit-and-miss’. They enjoy drawing on the rich seam of experience they have as former mathematics teachers and as mathematicians in a society that – how can we put this – does not always seem excited to hear about mathematics.  They are both authors, Darren of <em>Teaching Statistics</em> (Cup, 2018) and Lucy of <em>Flip the System UK: A Teachers’ Manifesto</em> (Routledge, 2017) and <em>The Equal Classroom: Life-Changing Thinking About Gender</em> (Routledge, 2019)."
