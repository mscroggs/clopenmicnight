    about="Kyle Evans is an award-winning comedian and maths communicator - combining comedy, song and extreme pedantry to lethal effect (not literally.) You'll find him performing family and grown-up shows at festivals, comedy clubs, schools, pubs, pie shops... anywhere that wants a venn diagram intersection of maths and entertainment. He's appeared several times on Radio 4's cult numbers show 'More or Less' and had a song about the Riemann Hypothesis turned into a local radio jingle. His new book <a href='https://atlantic-books.co.uk/book/maths-tricks-to-blow-your-mind/'>Maths Tricks to Blow Your Mind</a> is out on 7th October."
