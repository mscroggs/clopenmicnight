# Clopen Mic Night 1
On Thursday 26th August at 8-9pm (BST), we will be hosting the first Clopen Mic Night.
You can view the show live on YouTube at [youtu.be/HHTf2SCR8jE](https://youtu.be/HHTf2SCR8jE).

The show is free to watch, but we support our performers and pay our behind-the-scenes team 
for their work, so if you'd like to make a contribution - for example, as much as you'd pay 
for a ticket to a show - you can do so at any time by visiting 
[paypal.me/tmipuk](https://paypal.me/tmipuk).
