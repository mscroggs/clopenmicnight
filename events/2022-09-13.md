# [Clopen Mic Night #3: Clopen Sept](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOARCPdWgog)
On Tuesday 13th January at 8-9pm (GMT), we hosted the third Clopen Mic Night. You can [watch a recording on the Clopen Mic YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOARCPdWgog).

The show is free to watch, but we support our performers and pay our behind-the-scenes team 
for their work, so if you'd like to make a contribution - for example, as much as you'd pay 
for a ticket to a show - you can do so at any time by visiting
