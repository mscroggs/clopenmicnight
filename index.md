Clopen<a href='#footnote1'>*</a> Mic Night is a mathematical variety show featuring 
mathematicians, performers and maths communicators bringing you a
random<a href='#footnote2'>**</a> selection of comedy, music, art, demos and puzzles to
share and showcase their love of mathematics.

Clopen Mic Night happens on a semi-regular basis, in the evening from **8-9pm** (UK time), 
live on YouTube, with audience interaction in the YouTube Live Chat and a selection of four 
acts to enjoy. The first Clopen Mic Night will take place as part of the 2021 Talking Maths in 
Public conference, on **Thursday 26th August**. Check back here for the YouTube link and lineup 
nearer the time!

The show is free to watch, but we support our performers and pay our behind-the-scenes team 
for their work, so if you'd like to make a contribution - for example, as much as you'd pay 
for a ticket to a show - you can do so at any time by visiting 
[paypal.me/tmipuk](https://paypal.me/tmipuk). Clopen Mic Night is brought to you by the 
creators of the [24 Hour Maths Magic Show](https://24hourmaths.com), in partnership with 
[Talking Maths in Public](https://talkingmathsinpublic.uk/).

The show content will be aimed at an adult audience but the level of maths content should be 
accessible to anyone aged 14+.

<div class='footnote' id='footnote1'>* Clopen is an incredibly niche mathematical term for something that is both open and closed 
at the same time. If you'd like more information, find a friendly mathematician and ask them 
to tell you about it.

<div class='footnote' id='footnote2'>** Random is a fairly well-known mathematical term which means something is chosen as if by 
chance from some specified distribution such that examination of a large set of such items 
reproduces the underlying distribution.
