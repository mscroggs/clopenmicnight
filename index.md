Clopen<a href='#footnote1'>*</a> Mic Night is a mathematical variety show featuring 
mathematicians, performers and maths communicators bringing you a
random<a href='#footnote2'>**</a> selection of comedy, music, art, demos and puzzles to
share and showcase their love of mathematics.

[**Clopen Mic Night #5: The Power of Five**](/events/2025-05-01) will take place on **Thursday 1st May 2025**, aka 1/5/25.
You will be able to watch the show live or watch a recording of the show for a limited time on the [Clopen Mic YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVXsMDFH7eQ).
More details can be found on [the events page](events/index.md).

Clopen Mic Night happens on a semi-regular basis, live on YouTube, with audience interaction in the YouTube Live Chat and a selection of four 
acts to enjoy. The [first Clopen Mic Night](events/2021-08-26.md) took place as part of the 2021 Talking Maths in 
Public conference, on Thursday 26th August. Details of our shows can be found on [the events page](events/index.md).
You can sign up below to receive an email before our next event.

The show is free to watch, but we support our performers and pay our behind-the-scenes team 
for their work, so if you'd like to make a contribution - for example, as much as you'd pay 
for a ticket to a show - you can do so at any time by visiting 
[ko-fi.com/clopenmicnight](https://ko-fi.com/clopenmicnight) or
[paypal.me/tmipuk](https://paypal.me/tmipuk). Clopen Mic Night is brought to you by the 
creators of the [24 Hour Maths Magic Show](https://24hourmaths.com), in partnership with 
[Talking Maths in Public](https://talkingmathsinpublic.uk/).

The show content will be aimed at an adult audience but the level of maths content should be 
accessible to anyone aged 14+.

We'd like this event to be fun for everyone, so we have a code of
conduct: don't engage in exclusionary behaviour or language, harassment,
bullying, aggression or elitism, or make exclusionary jokes - not even
ironically. Use gender-neutral language where appropriate and respect
people's pronouns. This event is aimed at adults, so there may be some
swearing. If you have any concerns you can email us at
**hello@clopenmicnight.com**.

If you want to perform a piece of comedy, music, or art, do a demo, discuss a puzzle, or do anything else at a future Clopen Mic Night, then weâ€™d love to hear from you.
You can find more information about performing on our [backstage page](backstage.md).

<div class='footnote' id='footnote1'>* Clopen is an incredibly niche mathematical term for something that is both open and closed 
at the same time. If you'd like more information, find a friendly mathematician and ask them 
to tell you about it.
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='footnote2'>** Random is a fairly well-known mathematical term which means something is chosen as if by 
chance from some specified distribution such that examination of a large set of such items 
reproduces the underlying distribution.
