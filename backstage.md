If you want to perform a piece of comedy, music, or art, do a demo, discuss a puzzle, or do anything else at a
future Clopen Mic Night, then we encourage you to get in touch: you can drop us an email at **hello@clopenmicnight.com**.
We will aim to curate a selection of different types of acts to give a rounded line-up for each show, so we can't guarantee
that everyone who applies to perform will be put on in a particular show, but will do our best to work with people's
availability and preferences.

We are unable to guarantee a fee for our performers, but we will pay the backstage team and comp&egrave;re for each show
a guaranteed fee. Some members of our audience choose to support the show by sending tips on
[Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/clopenmicnight): we will give the performers a share of these tips once we have covered the costs
of running the show. 

The main benefit to performers is that Clopen Mic Night is an opportunity to try out a new thing you're working on, plug
your projects and upcoming events to a friendly audience, and get feedback from an experienced performer who watches the
live show, as well as a feedback form for the audience and a group discussion with the other acts post-show. Performers
who do not want this feedback are welcome to opt out of it.

We'd like this event to be fun for everyone, so we have a code of conduct for people participating:

- Don't engage in exclusionary behaviour or language against anyone based on their race/ethnicity, gender (binary, assigned
  or otherwise), disability, physical or mental health, sexual orientation, religion or belief, parental, pregnancy or
  relationship status, level of education or age. Don't make exclusionary jokes - not even ironically. Use gender-neutral
  language where appropriate, and respect people's pronouns.
- Harassment, bullying, aggression, elitism and inappropriate behaviour are all unwelcome. While the event is advertised as
  for adults (so you're free to swear if you want!), don't include any violent, gory or pornographic imagery or hate speech,
  in your set, on screen or in the background of your video.

We'll also ask people in the YouTube chat to keep things civil, and will have a moderator keeping an eye on the live chat to
block anyone causing trouble and/or delete anything inappropriate.
